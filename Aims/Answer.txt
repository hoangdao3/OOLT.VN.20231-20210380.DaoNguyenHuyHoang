3. Question 1: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
	objects still remain?
   Question 2: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
	the title of the JungleDVD changed?
   Answer 1: Because in swap method, we only pass the value of these class's title.
	In swap method, you try to change the value of o1 and o2, but these variation only happen in limit of swap method.
	And these variation don't affect two entry objects.
   Answer 2: Because the method directly modifies the title of objects by SetTitle() method.
